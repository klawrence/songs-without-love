==================
Songs, What are they about?

Most songs are about love but some aren't. I want to know what they are about.

When we are done, we'll be able to point Songs Without Love at a database of song lyrics and it will tell you what all the songs are about.

* Hurricane by Bob Dylan is about a boxer wrongly imprisoned for murder.
   * boxing, justice, crime
* Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft by The Carpenters is about making contact with aliens from outer-space.
   * extra-terrestrials, peace, earth
* Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush is about Kathy and Heathcliff on the wild, windy moors.
   * moors, love, weather

It will also be able to spot new trends in lyrics like:

* In the early seventies people started singing about space travel.
* Dancing was popular in the late fifties.
